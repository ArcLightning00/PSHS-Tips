# PSHS-Tips
Welcome to the Pisay Tips Code Development Team :D
Hi There! A few rules before you start to code
// First: Remember your purpose. You're here to help make the PSHS community better (unless you're not, if that's the case,
then coding this website is not for you). Please do so with effort. This is not for you alone. This is for something bigger than us.
// Second: Please have effort in the work. You were chosen here because you are good in coding or designing. We don't want slackers. We want people who are determined in their work. We all know what other people feel when others are slacking. Which leads
us to our third rule.
// Third: Have respect. We are a team here. We are working together to acheive a good goal. If you need any help. The team is gladly here at your service. Don't hesitate to ask :).
// Fourth: Enjoy. Most people don't like to be forced to do something. 
// Fifth: This isn't all what you do. You still have studies, friends, family. Take a break if you want maybe. Just be sure to come back. We can't do this alone. Good Luck peeps :).
